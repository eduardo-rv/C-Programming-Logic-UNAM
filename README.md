# 💻 Programming Fundamentals & Logic in C
### Applied Mathematics and Computing (MAC) - FES Acatlán, UNAM

This repository documents my **learning curve** and technical evolution in C programming. As an aspiring **Data Engineer**, I believe that mastering algorithmic logic and resource management from the ground up is essential for building efficient data systems in the future.

## 🎯 Objective
To solve incremental programming logic challenges, moving from basic variable manipulation to complex data structures and algorithms applied within the MAC curriculum.
